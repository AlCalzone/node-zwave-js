## 2.13.1 (2020-02-09)
### Bugfixes
* The lower limit for the `Multi Channel CC` has been set to V2

## 2.13.0 (2020-02-06)

## 2.12.2 (2020-01-26)
### Bugfixes
* `Thermostat Setpoint CC`: In Version 1 and 2, the setpoint type `N/A` is no longer scanned.

## 2.12.1 (2020-01-25)
### Bugfixes
* The node interview is no longer aborted when an unexpected `ConfigurationReport` is received
* Retrying the interview procedure now happens after a short waiting period to give nodes time to recover
* If a node times out after a confirmation, the sent message is retried just like if there was no response at all
* Messages to sleeping nodes are now also retried before immediately assuming they are asleep

## 2.12.0 (2020-01-25)
### Features
* When a node is removed from the network, all associations to it are also removed
* The interview procedure is now canceled and retried when an error occurs instead of silently failing all futher steps
* The progress report for network healing distinguishes between failed, skipped, pending and healed nodes.

### Bugfixes
* The network heal now skips nodes that are dead or likely dead

### Changes under the hood
* Added some lint rules for the firmware in device config files

## 2.11.1 (2020-01-21)
### Bugfixes
* A potential source of stalled communication because of a missing timeout was eliminated
* The progress report for network healing now correctly distinguishes between not yet healed nodes and nodes that failed to heal

### Changes under the hood
* Improved the log output for bullet points as well as sent and received messages
* Log lines that are completely filled and have secondary tags no longer include garbage when logging to a file

## 2.11.0 (2020-01-21)
### Features
* Implemented the `Supervision` CC. The `Driver` now has two additional methods to make use of that feature:
    * `sendSupervisedCommand()`: Sends a command to a node using supervision and returns with the reported status (success, working, fail). This method throws if `Supervision CC` is not supported.
    * `trySendCommandSupervised()`: Convenience wrapper around `sendSupervisedCommand` and `sendCommand`. Automatically determines whether supervision is supported. Returns the supervision status if it is, and nothing otherwise
* The `Multilevel Switch CC` now makes use of supervised set commands if possible.

### Bugfixes
* Messages to sleeping nodes are now correctly de-prioritized when the awake timeout elapses
* Messages are now automatically re-transmitted when the controller responds with a `NAK` or when it fails to respond at all
* `ACK`s from the controller after a retransmit are no longer treated as unexpected
* The logic that determines a message's role (expected, unexpected, confirmation, ...) now takes the encapsulation stack into account.

## 2.10.0 (2020-01-18)
### Features
* Locally reset devices are now treated like failing nodes and automatically removed from the controller
* The `Notification` status is now also queried on wakeup
* The status of non-reporting listening nodes is now regularly queried

### Bugfixes
* The controller is now correctly treated as an awake node when prioritizing messages
* The partial interview for the `Meter` CC no longer re-queries the capabilities
* All timeouts and intervals are now cleared when the driver is shut down.

## 2.9.1 (2020-01-07)
### Bugfixes
* `Notification CC` Reports that are received as a response during the interview are now correctly handled
* The `ready` event is now only for nodes that are known to be alive or asleep
* After `removeFailedNode()` has succeeded, the node is removed from the driver and the corresponding events are emitted
* The `alive`, `awake` and `dead` events are now also emitted for nodes if their status was previously unknown.
* After a node was removed or marked as dead, the check for `all nodes ready` is performed again
* Dead nodes are ignored in the check for `all nodes ready` to avoid the necessity for physical user interaction

## 2.9.0 (2020-01-05)
### Features
* Added `isFailedNode()` and `removeFailedNode()` to the `Controller` class
* The scenes of the `Scene Activation` CC are now automatically reset after the duration has elapsed.

## 2.8.0 (2020-01-04)
### Features
* Added the driver options `fs` and `cacheDir` to replace the default fs driver and/or cache directory

## 2.7.1 (2020-01-04)
### Bugfixes
* The `Indicator CC` `setValue` API now accepts `boolean` values for binary indicators

## 2.7.0 (2020-01-03)
### Features
* `Basic CC` reports no longer create a value when they are mapped to another CC
* `IndicatorCC`:
    * Binary indicators now use `boolean` values
    * V1 indicators (unspecified) are now ignored if an endpoint is known to have V2 indicators

### Bugfixes
* Many occurences of `TODO: no handler for application command` in the log were removed
* The driver is no longer reset when unexpected data is received. Instead the invalid bytes are skipped.

## 2.6.0 (2020-01-02)
### Features
* Implemented `Scene Activation` CC

### Bugfixes
* The env variables `LOGTOFILE` and `LOGLEVEL` are now lazily evaluated

## 2.5.2 (2020-01-01)
### Bugfixes
* Removed a duplicate config parameter from Heatit Z-Scene Controller
* `IndicatorCC`: The first indicator ID is no longer ignored

## 2.5.1 (2019-12-30)
### Bugfixes
* The device config is now also loaded when deserializing nodes from the cache

## 2.5.0 (2019-12-30)
### Features
* Added the event `"ready"` to `ZWaveNode` and `"all nodes ready"` to `Driver` to notify users that a node respectively all nodes are safe to be used

### Bugfixes (or maybe it's a feature?)
* `BasicCCSet` commands that are received from a node are now treated like reports
* If possible, received `BasicCC` commands are mapped to specific CCs

### Definitely Bugfixes
* Avoid resetting the IO layer while the driver is not ready
* `IndicatorCC`: 
    * Corrected the expected response to `SupportedGet` command
    * Improved property(Key) translation
* `MeterCC`: Add translation for property and propertyKey

## 2.4.1 (2019-12-18)
### Bugfixes
* Fixed a crash that happens when a `MultiChannelCCAggregatedMembersReport` is received.
* Fixed a crash that happens when receiving a message from a node endpoint, but that endpoint was not known to the controller

## 2.4.0 (2019-12-17)
### Features
* The log output now contains the version of this library (and a fancy title!)
* Reworked the `healNetwork` process:
    * The controller now has two additional methods: `beginHealingNetwork` and `stopHealingNetwork`. The original `healNetwork` now simply calls `beginHealingNetwork` and is deprecated.
    * Two additional events (`heal network progress` and `heal network done`) are emitted during the process. The event callback receives a map with the current process: *node id* (`number`) => *heal done* (`boolean`).
* Pending messages are now automatically removed from the send queue if they no longer serve a purpose (e.g. node removed or healing process stopped)
* The status of sleeping nodes is automatically reset to `asleep` 10 seconds after the wake up or the last completed transaction.

### Bugfixes
* Config parameters are no longer queried multiple times if there are partial config params defined
* If a ping failed and the node's messages are moved to the wake up queue, the send queue is no longer stalled by the unanswered ping
* When sending a message to a node that is known to be asleep, the message's priority is automatically set to `Wake Up` (except for `NoOperationCC`s).

## 2.3.0 (2019-12-14)
### Features
* Using the env variable `LOGTOFILE=true`, the log output can now be redirected to a file instead of `stdout`.

### Bugfixes
* Updated `alcalzone-shared` lib to a working version
* The parameter number during interview of `Configuration CC` is now logged correctly instead of `[object Object]`.

### Changes under the hood
* Updated several dependencies

## 2.2.1 (2019-12-13)
### Bugfixes
* Removed deadlocks that happened when stopping the inclusion or exclusion process
* The start and stop of an in- or exclusion process is now correctly announced using the `inclusion started`, `inclusion stopped`, `exclusion started` and `exclusion stopped` events.

## 2.2.0 (2019-12-11)
### Bugfixes
* Accessing a node's or endpoint's `commandClasses` property with `Symbol`s no longer causes a crash
* Revised querying logic for devices without Z-Wave+ or Lifeline associations

### Features
* Added support for `Indicator CC`

## 2.1.1 (2019-12-07)
### Bugfixes
* The serial port will now only be closed if it is already open. This causes less errors to be thrown when opening the port fails.

## 2.1.0 (2019-12-01)
### Features
* Added support for `Meter CC`

### Bugfixes
* Fixed a crash that happened when setting a configuration value that would not fit in the configured value size by marking many configuration parameters in device config files as unsigned.

### Changes under the hood
* The min/max value for configuration parameters in device config files is now validated

## 2.0.1 (2019-11-27)
### Bugfixes
* Fixed a crash that happened when saving the network cache with a CC that is neither supported nor controlled

### Changes under the hood
* Errors in stack traces are now mapped to the original TypeScript sources.

## 2.0.0 (2019-11-26)
### Changes for users
* The `value updated` event is no longer emitted for `interviewComplete` every time a command is received
* `Basic CC` is no longer reported as supported when other actuator CCs are supported
* If a node only controls a CC, the corresponding CCAPI is no longer falsely offered
* The driver no longer overrides the CC version that was determined by the CC constructor
* `Binary Sensor CC` is now correctly interviewed
* Added a large amount of device configuration files. This powers the `Configuration CC` for versions <3 and enables lifeline associations for devices that don't support the Z-Wave+ standard.
* Renamed a few manufacturers
* When devices wake up that neither support Z-Wave+ nor have a lifeline association, all sensor and actuator CCs are queried for updated values

### Bugfixes
* `Multi Channel CC` no longer queries endpoint #0 if EndpointFind returns no results or only zeroes.
* When values and metadata are deserialized from the cache, no more events are emitted. If you relied on this behavior, use `getDefinedValueIDs()` instead **after** the interview was completed.

### Breaking changes
* Added a new member to `ValueID`: `property` (`number | string`) replaces `propertyName` as the property identifier. `propertyName` is now in line with `commandClassName` and `propertyKeyName` and contains a speaking representation of the property
