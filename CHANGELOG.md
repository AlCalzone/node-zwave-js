## __WORK IN PROGRESS__
### Changes for users
* The `value updated` event is no longer emitted for `interviewComplete` every time a command is received
* `Basic CC` is no longer reported as supported when other actuator CCs are supported

### Breaking changes
* Added a new member to `ValueID`: `property` (`number | string`) replaces `propertyName` as the property identifier. `propertyName` is now in line with `commandClassName` and `propertyKeyName` and contains a speaking representation of the property

### Changes under the hood
* Deduplicated some code in the config lint script
* Upgrade to TypeScript 3.7
* The `ccCommand` properties' types are now specified using `declare` class fields instead of interface merging

## 1.7.0 (2019-11-03)
* Support interviewing multi channel endpoints
* Improve performance by not formatting logs that won't be visible
* `Multi Channel CC`: Mark `commandClasses` property as internal
* Upgrade to TypeScript 3.7 RC
* Remove secondary switch functionality from `Multilevel Switch CC`
* Implement interview procedure for `Multilevel Switch CC`
* Upgrade Prettier and ESLint to make use of the new TS 3.7 syntax
* Update Multilevel Sensor definitions to latest specs and rename some sensor types
* Move sensor type and scale definitions to JSON config files
* Extract named scales to their own configuration file
* Also use scale configuration for `Thermostat Setpoint CC`
* Improve error output for `lint:config` script
* Upgrade `serialport` to version 8
* Create CC instances for all endpoints in `getDefinedValueIDs`

## 1.6.0 (2019-10-23)
* Implement Multi Channel Association CC and prefer it to Association CC if possible
* Implement AssociationGroupInfoCC
* Add support for CRC-16 CC
* Bump Association CC to V3, which adds no new commands
* Add setValue API to TimeParametersCC and use JS date objects
* Add set value API to NodeNamingAndLocationCC
* Add interview for Multilevel Sensor CC, fix scale parsing
* Add interview for Thermostat Setback CC
* Add interview for Central Scene CC
* Filter out internal key value pairs in `getDefinedValueIDs`
* Add tests (and the necessary snippets) for CC serialization and deserialization routines and fix the found errors:
    * Central Scene: fix calculation of scene bitmask size
    * Association Group Information: fix offset during parsing of InfoReport
    * (Multi Channel) Association: fix broken check for negative group IDs
    * Handle encapsulation (de)serialization correctly
* Help GitHub understand that this is not a C(++)-repo
* Add interview implemention to tracking issue
* Moved `supportsCommand` from `CommandClass` to `CCAPI`
* CC API methods now check that the underlying command is supported by the node
* Improved handling of bit masks
* Implement interview for ConfigurationCC, include spec changes
* Don't interview CCs the VersionCC reports as unsupported
* Cleanup loglevels for some log outputs
* Update dependencies

* Add interview procedure for BasicCC
* Add the option to specify a minimum version for ccValues
