	"info_overview": "<p>The<strong> ZWP10</strong> multi-channel remote control enables radio control of FAKRO electrical accessories and of other manufacturers which are compatible with the Z-Wave communication module. The ZWP10 remote control can be used to operate up to 10 devices individually on five channels (two devices per channel). It also allows the creation of 10 independent groups. Each group can contain several devices operated simultaneously.</p> <p>The controller's memory can contain up to 231 devices.</p> <p>The ZWP10 remote control can serve as the basic controller (PRIMARY) and additional controller (SECONDARY). The PRIMARY controller allows to integrate numerous devices into one radio network, while the SECONDARY controller acts as additional controller in an already existing network.</p> <p>In addition to Basic control mode, i.e.: ?, ⏹️, ?, the ZWP10 remote control also features Multilevel mode which allows e.g. for smooth dimming of light or smooth operation of roller shutters and blinds (by keeping the ? or ? button pressed).

	"info_inclusion": "<p>By default the ZWP10 is the primary controller. Inclusion mode is enabled by pressing once the IN/EX button at the back of the remote control. LEDs 1 and 4 will turn on.

Upon successful inclusion, LEDs 2 &amp; 3 will briefly turn on.</p> <p>In case the ZWP10 is added to an existing network: set the primary controller in INCLUDE mode. Press three times the IN/EX button at the back of the ZWP10 remote control to be included until LEDs 1 and 3 turn on.

	"info_wakeup": "<p>The user manual doesn't provide information about waking up the ZWP10 portable remote. However, communication with the primary controller can be initiated by pressing the SELECT button (↔️) for <strong>at least 3 seconds</strong> until LEDs 1, 2, 3 and 4 start blinking. Communication starts when releasing the SELECT button (↔️). LEDs 1, 2, 3 and 4 will keep blink simultaneously until the communication is finished.</p>    ",
	"info_usage": "<p>The <strong>ZWP10</strong> controller enables radio control of FAKRO electrical accessories and of other manufacturers that are compatible with the Z-Wave system. The ZWP10 controller operates up to 10 devices, separately on 5 channels (2 devices for 1 channel). It also allows the creation of 10 independent groups. Each group can include several devices operated simultaneously.</p> <p>The ZWP10 controller's memory can contain up to 231 devices.</p> <p>The ZWP10 controller is equipped with a two-way Z-Wave radio communication module exploiting radio wave frequency (frequency depending on the country for which the product is intended). It can be used as the basic controller – PRIMARY (default) as well as an additional controller – SECONDARY. The PRIMARY controller allows for integration of many devices into one radio network while the SECONDARY controller is used as an additional controller in an already existing network (see LEARN MODE function).</p> <h1>1. Operation modes</h1> <p>In addition to <strong>Basic Mode</strong> of operation (?, ⏹️, ?), the ZWP10 controller offers <strong>Multilevel Mode</strong> allowing for e.g. smooth dimming of light or partial opening of blinds and shutters:</p> <ul><li> <p><strong>Basic</strong> – press function buttons (? or ?) in order to cause the device to move and press ⏹️ in order to stop the device.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Multilevel</strong> – keep function button (? or ?) pressed until until the device reaches desired position. Operation stops when button of movement is released.</p> </li> </ul><p>Switch between the 5 channels by pressing repeatedly the SELECT button (↔️) until the desired channel is selected. The green LEDs will indicate the selected channel:</p> <ol><li>Channel 1: LED 1</li> <li>Channel 2: LED 2</li> <li>Channel 3: LED 3</li> <li>Channel 4: LED 4</li> <li>Channel 5: LEDs 1, 2, 3, 4</li> </ol><p>Each channel features 2 sets of function buttons (?, ⏹️, ?). Each set can be assigned to a device or a device group.</p> <h1>2. Adding devices to the controller</h1> <p>Devices can be added to the controller in several ways.</p> <h2>2.1 Including the device and simultaneously assigning to function buttons  – Combined INCLUDE &amp; ASSOCIATE mode</h2> <ol><li>On the <strong>ZWP10 controller</strong>: <ol><li>Select the channel to which the device should be added by pressing repeatedly the SELECT button (↔️) until the desired channel is selected</li> <li>Press <strong>once</strong> the IN/EX button at the back of the ZWP10 controller. LEDs 1 &amp; 4 will now turn on</li> <li>Press a function button (? or ?) of the channel you want to assign the device to (left or right).<br /><em>(Note: do not press the </em>⏹️<em> button as it triggers another mode.)<br /></em>LEDs 2, 3 &amp; 4 will now turn on.</li> </ol></li> <li>On the <strong>device to be included</strong>: <ol><li>Within 10 seconds, press the INCLUDE button (P button on Fakro Z-Wave devices) until the device's network LED switches off.</li> <li>The ZWP10 controller will confirm success by briefly blinking LEDs 2, 3 &amp; 4.</li> <li>If the inclusion failed, LEDs 1, 2 &amp; 3 will briefly blink.
