No. VRCPG, press the Menu button and scroll down to System Setup. Press the center button to select System Setup Menu. Choose Advance Settings. Press the center button to select Network. Press the center button to &lt;Include Node&gt;.</p> <p>B) If using VRCPG Programmer/Remote, you will be prompted to place 4-Zone controller into programming mode.</p> <p>C) To access Program mode, press and hold the left side of buttons 1 and 3 (refer to figure). Wait 5 seconds until the LED turns Amber. Release the button and the LED will blink Amber. You are now in Programming mode.</p> <p>NOTE: If the LED on the 4-Zone controller turns solid Red while including, there has been a communication error.</p> <p>D) While standing close to the 4-Zone controller (approximately 1 foot), press the center button on the Programmer/Remote to &lt;Include&gt; device in the network.</p> <p>NOTE: Only one device may be included at any time.</p> <p>NOTE: If the LED on the 4-scene controller turns solid Red while including, there has been a communication error.</p> <p>E) The Primary Programmer/Remote will assign a Home ID, Node ID, and Name for this device.</p> <p>NOTE: This information will be stored in the Programmer/Remote to be used for future reference.</p> <p>NOTE: You may name or edit the node of this device at this time.</p> <p>F) The 4-Zone controller is now installed in the network.</p> <p>G) After all devices are included into the network, the controller must be updated to allow proper network function. To update controller proceed as follows:</p> <p>• If using a non-Leviton Programmer/Remote, refer to the Programmer/Remote instruction sheet for updating controller.</p> <p>• If using Leviton Z-Wave® Programmer/Remote, Cat.

To accomplish this, proceed as follows:</p> <p>• On the 4-Zone controller (refer to figure), press and hold the left side of buttons 1 and 3. Wait approximately 5 seconds until the locator LED turns Amber and then flashes Red. Release the buttons. The 4-Zone controller is now reset. Once the controller is reset, it will be necessary to</p> <p>Re-Include it to a network before it can be used.</p> <p>CAUTION: SETTING A DEVICE TO A FACTORY DEFAULT DOES NOT EXCLUDE THAT DEVICE FROM A NETWORK. THE EXCLUSION PROCEDURE MUST STILL BE FOLLOWED TO REMOVE THE DEVICE FROM THE PRIMARY CONTROLLER’S INFORMATION TABLE. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN SYSTEM THAT IS SLOW TO RESPOND, OR MAY FAIL TO RESPOND TO SOME DEVICES.</p>",
