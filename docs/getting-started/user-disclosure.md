# Project-Provided User Disclosure

Please allow the zwave-js project to collect some anonymized data regarding the devices you own so that we can generate statistics that allow us to better focus our development efforts. This information is not tracked to any identifiable user or IP address. Specifically, we'd like to collect: (1) a hash of your network ID to prevent duplicate records (this hash cannot be undone to reveal your network ID); (2) information about which version of zwave-js you are running; and (3) the manufacturer ID, product type, product ID, and firmware version of each device that is connected to zwave-js.

Collecting this information is critical to the user experience provided by zwave-js. More information about the data that is collected and how it is used, including an example of the data collected, can be found at: https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/user-disclosure.
