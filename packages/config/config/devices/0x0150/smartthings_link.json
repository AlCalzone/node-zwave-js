You can factory reset your Hub with Remove\n\nDevice menu in SmartThings mobile app.\n\nNOTE : Resetting the Hub will restore factory\n\nsettings. All device connections, automations, rules,\n\nconfigurations associated with that Hub will be lost\n\nin the reset. All devices connected to your Hub will\n\nhave to be reset or excluded before they can be\n\nreconnected. The steps for resetting and\n\nreconnecting each smart device differ. After\n\nresetting, you can visit our Things category, find the\n\ndevices you wish to set up, and follow the guides\n\nprovided. Remember that you will likely need to\n\nreset or “exclude” every device before connecting"
