		"inclusion": "Strips is delivered in \"\"auto-add\"\" mode. Follow the process below to add Strips in a Z-Wave network. 1. Start the add mode on the Z-Wave controller. See the controller’s manual. 2. Remove both magnets from Strips. Strips blinks twice to confirm the command and successful addition. 3. A long LED blink indicates that the add process was successful 4. The Z-Wave controller application should now allow you to monitor your Strips sensor status. 5. Move the squared magnet as shown in the picture . Check that the Z-Wave system indicates the status correctly 6. If the Z-Wave system do not respond, it may be needed to change Strips’ notification type. Manual add: 1. Set the controller to add mode (See your controller’s manual). 2. Place the round magnet at the rounded edge of Strips. When the LED blinks, move the magnet away. Repeat 3 times in total within 10 seconds. 3. A long LED blink indicates that the add process was successful.",

When the LED blinks, move the magnet away. Repeat 3 times in total within 10 seconds. 3. After 5 LED blinks, place the magnet at the rounded edge again for 10 seconds. 4. A long LED signal indicates success."
