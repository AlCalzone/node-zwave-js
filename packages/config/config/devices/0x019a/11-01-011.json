Start the add mode on the Z-Wave controller. \n\nSee the controller’s manual.\n\n2. Remove both magnets from the iamsmart Window & Door Sensor. The iamsmart Window & Door Sensor blinks twice to confirm the command and successful addition. \n\n3. A long LED blink indicates that the add process was successful\n\n4. The Z-Wave controller application should now allow you to monitor your iamsmart Window & Door Sensor status.\n\n5. Move the squared magnet as shown in the picture . Check that the Z-Wave system indicates the status correctly.\n\n6. If the Z-Wave system does not respond, it may be needed to change the iamsmart Window & Door Sensor’s notification type.\n\nManual add:\n\n1. Set the controller to add mode (See your controller’s manual). \n\n2. Place the round magnet at the rounded edge of the iamsmart Window & Door Sensor. \n\nWhen the LED blinks, move the magnet away. Repeat 3 times in total within 10 seconds. \n\n3. A long LED blink indicates that the add process was successful",
