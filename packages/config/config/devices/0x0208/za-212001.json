		"inclusion": "To include RGB BULB into a Z-Wave network as a non-security device:\n(1) Make sure the power supply is disconnected and the RGB BULB is\nlocated within a direct Z-Wave network's main controller\ncommunication range.\n(2) Set the Z-Wave network main controller into learning mode\n(see Z-Wave network controller operating manual).\n(3) Insert the RGB BULB into a lamp-socket and then power on.\n(4) Auto-inclusion will be activated. If the inclusion is successful, the\nRGB BULB will blink fast in blue for less than 5 seconds and then\nkeep on for 3 seconds. RGB BULB will keep on in the color before it\nis included into the Z-Wave network after the inclusion procedure\nis finished.\n\nTo include RGB BULB into a Z-Wave network as a security device:\n(1) Screw in the RGB BULB.\n(2) Set the Z-Wave network main controller into learning mode\n(see Z-Wave network controller operating manual).\n(3) Toggle the wall switch off and on 3 times quickly (within 3 seconds\nand the final ending position of the wall switch must be on).\n(4) If the inclusion is successful, the RGB BULB will blink fast in green\nfor less than 5 seconds and then keep on 3 seconds. RGB BULB will\nkeep on in the color before it is included into the Z-Wave network\nafter the inclusion procedure is finished",

		"reset": "There are two ways to reset the RGB BULB. One is that removing\nRGB BULB from the Z-Wave network, the other is that using the\nconfiguration command class.Please use this procedure only when\n the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable",
